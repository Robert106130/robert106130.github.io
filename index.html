    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The Mystery Black Box and it's inconsistent data is not as complicated as we think and there is an explaination for why results may vary.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p> My model was not the most structurally stable, but from analyzing the black boxâ€™s data. There would be anomalies of getting more or less of the same mL of water as before. For example inputting 500 mL you may receive 135 mL or you could enter 500 mL and receive 800 mL hypothetically. The logical explanation for this is that the water is being transferred between the output and container, with the container occasionally spilling over every once in a while.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 1</h1>
    <p>Had my model been more structurally stable, I would be able to give my own results. The issue at hand is that we functionality is there, but me and my group ran into the issue of leaks parts not working as intended/efficiently.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 2</h1>
    <p>My belival in the idea of there being two places the water is being transferred to is because of the water going through the output. The results would be more consistent unless there is a blockage of water in the tube/pipe that never went through could be another cause for more water or less water with every trial.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 3</h1>
    <p>As stated previously if the water is not being transferred from one container and or pipe to another then. The results we would be getting would be more consistent which the black box has not shown.</p>
